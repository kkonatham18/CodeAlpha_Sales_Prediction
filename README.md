# CodeAlpha_Sales_Prediction

## 🚀 Project Overview
**Sales Prediction using Python** is a machine learning project that predicts sales based on advertising expenditure across TV, Radio, and Newspaper platforms.  
This project was completed as part of the **CodeAlpha Data Science Internship (10th Jan 2026 – 10th Feb 2026)**.

The model provides actionable insights into which advertising channels have the most impact on sales, helping businesses make data-driven marketing decisions.

## 📈 Workflow
1. **Data Loading & Cleaning** – Import dataset, check for missing values.  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Visualize relationships and correlations between features and sales.  
3. **Model Training** – Split data into train-test sets, train a Linear Regression model.  
4. **Model Evaluation** – Evaluate performance using R² Score and Mean Squared Error (MSE).  
5. **Sales Prediction** – Predict future sales for given advertising budgets.  
6. **Insights & Recommendations** – Determine which advertising channels have the highest impact on sales.

## 🔍 Key Insights
- **TV advertising** has the highest impact on sales.  
- **Radio advertising** contributes moderately to sales growth.  
- **Newspaper advertising** shows limited influence.  
- Linear Regression model achieved **high predictive accuracy** (R² Score > 0.9, low MSE).  
- Businesses can **optimize marketing budgets** by investing more in TV and Radio ads and reducing Newspaper spend.

---

## 💡 Actionable Recommendations
- Focus more on TV advertising for maximum sales impact.  
- Use Radio as a complementary channel.  
- Reallocate budget from Newspaper to higher-performing channels.
